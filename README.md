# STUDENT-PERFORMANCE-ANALYTICS-DASHBOARD
## Data Science & Analytics Internship Project – Tamizhan Skills

## Introduction
This project, Student Performance Analytics Dashboard, is developed as part of the Data Science and Analytics Internship at Tamizhan Skills. Educational institutions increasingly rely on data-driven insights to monitor student progress, identify academic risks early, and design timely interventions. This project demonstrates how data analytics and visualization techniques can be used to analyze student academic performance and highlight students who may be at risk of failure or dropout.
Using Python-based data analysis tools, this project transforms raw student data into meaningful insights through statistical analysis and visual dashboards.

## Problem Statement
Educational institutions often lack early warning systems to identify students who are struggling academically. Without proper analysis of attendance, internal marks, assignments, and study behavior, at-risk students may go unnoticed until final exam results.

## Objective
The objectives of this project are to:
- Analyze student academic data
- Identify performance trends among students
- Understand the impact of attendance and study habits
- Highlight top-performing and struggling students
- Use visual dashboards to support academic decision-making
- This project supports the Tamizhan Skills internship goal of applying data science concepts to real-world social and educational problems.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (Final_Marks_Data.csv) contains student academic details, including:
- Student_ID
- Attendance (%)
- Internal Test 1 Marks (out of 40)
- Internal Test 2 Marks (out of 40)
- Assignment Score (out of 10)
- Daily Study Hours
- Final Exam Marks (out of 100)
- The dataset is preprocessed to ensure all numerical values are properly formatted for analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas – Data loading and preprocessing
- Matplotlib – Bar chart visualizations
- Seaborn – Correlation heatmap visualization

## Methodology
The analysis workflow implemented in the program code includes:
- Loading the student dataset using Pandas
- Renaming columns for consistency and easier access
- Converting academic attributes into numeric format
- Sorting students based on final exam marks
- Visualizing Top 20 high-performing students using bar charts
- Visualizing Bottom 20 struggling students using bar charts
- Calculating correlation between attendance, internal marks, assignments, study hours, and final exam performance
- Displaying correlation results using a heatmap dashboard

## OUTPUT

Correlation Heatmap showing relationships between:
- Attendance
- Internal test scores
- Assignments
- Study hours
- Final exam marks
- These visualizations act as a performance analytics dashboard for academic monitoring.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates how data science and analytics can be applied in the education domain to improve student outcomes. Through the Tamizhan Skills Data Science & Analytics Internship, practical experience was gained in data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and visualization. The dashboard created through this project can help institutions take early action to support struggling students and improve overall academic performance.
